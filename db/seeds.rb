  {title: "Warcraft II Battle.net Edition", description: "The Kingdom of Azeroth was relatively peaceful and ruled by King Llane. That was until a powerful mage named Medivh commanded forces that opened up a portal in the Swamp of Sorrow, leading to another world. This ushered in the Age of Chaos, as Orcs were summoned to this world and attempted to establish an empire. As the Orcish hordes swarmed from the portal, they met with the Humans of Azeroth and mighty battles ensued. \n\nSix years have now passed since the first war between man and orc and the battles for the kingdoms of the World of Warcraft are far from being over...\n\nWarcraft II: Battle.net Edition contains both Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, and the expansion - Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal.\n\nWarcraft II: Tides of Darkness\nThe First War brought the Fall of Azeroth, following the Orc campaign in Warcraft: Orcs & Humans. The survivors of Azeroth have fled by sea to the Human kingdom of Lordaeron, and with the conquest of the kingdom of Azeroth in the first war, the orcs are now preparing for an invasion of Lordaeron to conquer the remaining human, dwarven and elvish realms. In an effort to counter this invasion the humans, elves and dwarves have formed an alliance in the hope to avert the same fate the kingdom of Azeroth met. Both sides have acquired allies and new capabilities, including naval and air units, and more powerful spellcasters.  This will become known as The Second War.\n\nWarcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal\nAfter destroying the mystic gate into Azeroth, the Humans discover that the rift which allows the Orcs passage into their world still exists. Human forces must now venture beyond the Dark Portal into orcish lands to put an end to the threat of yet another invasion by the hordes.\n\nWarcraft II: is a fantasy-themed real-time strategy (RTS) game published by Blizzard Entertainment and first released for DOS in 1995 and for Mac OS in 1996. The main game, Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness, earned enthusiastic reviews, won most of the major PC gaming awards in 1996, and sold over 2 million copies.\n\nLater in 1996 Blizzard released an expansion pack Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal for DOS and Mac OS, and a compilation Warcraft II: The Dark Saga for the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn. The Battle.net Edition, released in 1999, provided Blizzard's online gaming service, Battle.net, and replaced the MS-DOS version with a Windows one.\n\nWarcraft II allows players to play against AI opponents in separate Human and Orc campaigns, and in stand-alone scenarios. Most of the campaign missions follow the pattern \"collect resources, build buildings and units, destroy opponents\". However, some have other objectives, such as rescuing troops or forts, or escorting important characters through enemy territory.\n\nPlayers must collect resources, and produce buildings and units in order to defeat an opponent in combat on the ground, in the air and in some maps at sea. The more advanced combat units are produced at the same buildings as the basic units but also need the assistance of other buildings, or must be produced at buildings that have prerequisite buildings. The majority of the main screen shows the part of the territory on which the player is currently operating, and the minimap can select another location to appear in the larger display. The fog of war completely hides all territory which the player has not explored, and shows only terrain but hides opponents' units and buildings if none of the player's units are present.\n\nThe game's map editor allows players to develop scenarios for use in multiplayer contests and against AI opponents.", release_date: "09/30/1999", platform: "PC", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/10990-1.jpg"},

However, Illidan gains an artifact known as the 'Eye Of Sargeras' and wipes out some of Maiev's best soldiers. Forced to call for help, she sends a messenger back to the mainland of Kalimdor. She asks the assistance of Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind, but Maiev holds a grudge against Tyrande for her actions in releasing Illidan. Although they are able to chase Illidan to Lordaeron, while helping the Blood Elven prince Kael'Thas, Tyrande delays the advance on an Undead army that causes her to be swept away downriver: upon their reunion, Maiev lied to Malfurion, claiming Tyrande was killed in order to prevent Illidan's escape. Malfurion and Maiev prevent Illidan from using the artifact called the Eye of Sargeras, defeat his army and condemn him to death. Illidan tries to justify his actions by saying his plan was to use the Eye to destroy the Icecrown Glacier and kill the Lich King, thereby destroying their common enemy in the Undead, but Malfurion accuses Illidan of having indirectly causing Tyrande's death. Kael'thas then informs him Tyrande may have survived; Maiev's treachery comes out, and the brothers Stormrage join forces to save Tyrande. At this point, Kael'Thas supposedly takes a few more days to meet up with the human forces in the city of Dalaran, the exact same city in which they stopped Illidan. Malfurion then pardons Illidan after they save Tyrande, though he does not revoke his exile. Illidan then states that he could not join the Night Elves even if Malfurion did permit it, because his master will be enraged by his failure to use the Eye properly, and will hunt him down. Illidan departs for Outland, followed by Maiev. It seems as though Maiev would chase Illidan to the depths of the world, as she would do so. Malfurion then remarks that she has become 'vengeance itself'.", release_date: "07/01/2003", platform: "PC", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/803-1.jpg"},

While Soap receives medical attention, Vladamir Makarov's forces storm the safehouse in an attempt to kill the three. An ex-Spetsnaz soldier, Yuri, aids Price in giving Soap medical help, and with securing a safe route to an extraction point out of the country. Together, the four are all that remains of the disavowed Task Force 141. They follow Makarov's trail to an arms deal in Sierra Leone and a warlord in Somalia as chemical weapons are distributed to Paris, Berlin, and London.\n\nMeanwhile, the Russian invasion of the United States continues, culminating in the Battle of Lower Manhattan, New York. The actions of the Delta Force team callsigned “Team Metal”, including Sgt. Derek \"Frost\" Westbrook, Grinch, Truck, and their superior officer Sandman, facilitate the Russian withdrawal from New York. While this is going on, Russian President Boris Vorshevsky announces plans to make peace with the United States at a summit in Hamburg, Germany. The plan is derailed when men loyal to Makarov kidnap him and attempt to do the same with his daughter, Alena. Thwarting a chemical attack on Paris, Team Metal locate Makarov in Prague. Price contacts MacMillan, his former mentor, now callsigned Baseplate for England's forces. MacMillan gives him intel on a warlord named Waraabe, located in Somalia. After torturing him, Waraabe gives Price, Soap, and Yuri the name of Mararov's new right-hand man, a French bombmaker named Volk, who is located in Paris. Price contacts Sandman with this info, leading to Delta Force raiding the Montmartre Hill in Paris. They capture Volk and are able to escape, at the cost of the Eiffel Tower's destruction. After torturing him, Volk reveals Makarov's location to Sandman, being in Prague in Hotel Lustig.\n\nOnce in Prague, Taskforce 141 meets up with Loyalist Kamarov to attempt an assassination of Makarov. However, the plan \"goes south\" when Kamarov himself is taken hostage and rigged with explosives. Price escapes just as Kamarov is blown up. Makarov reveals that he knows Yuri personally. Before Soap dies of his wounds during their escape, Soap tells Price that \"Makarov...knows...Yuri...\" After leaving his pistol behind with Soap's body, an enraged Price punches Yuri down a staircase and is prepared to kill him. Yuri explains that he was present with Makarov at Price’s assassination mission, the nuclear detonation in the Middle East, and the massacre at the Zakhaev Internation Airport in Russia. Yuri reveals that he'd attempted to prevent the massacre, but was shot in the stomach by Makarov before he could stop it. However, he is able to reach the airport floors and tries to go after Makarov, but falls unconcious, and is later found by medics. This convinces Price that they are fighting for the same thing, and Price decides to keep his alliance with Yuri.\n\nLearning of President Vorshevsky’s captivity, Price and Yuri alert Team Metal of an Ultranationalist plan to abduct Alena from a safehouse in Berlin. Team Metal are unable to prevent the kidnapping, but they are able to trace Makarov's Ultranationalists to a diamond mine in Siberia. Team Metal and Task Force 141 launch a rescue operation to save the Vorshevskys. Their actions ensure the safety of the Russian President and his daughter, and end the conflict between the United States and Russia. However, Team Metal is killed during the extraction, when the mine collapses on them.\n\nWith the war over, Price and Yuri track Makarov to the Hotel Oasis (loosely based on the Burj Al Arab in Dubai) in the Arabian Peninsula. On the hotel roof, Makarov attempts to escape on a helicopter, but Price stops him. Makarov prepares to execute Price, but it interrupted by Yuri; Makarov shoots Yuri instead. Price takes advantage of the moment and wraps a cable around Makarov's throat and smashing through the glass, resulting in Makarov's death.

The objective is to match Yoshi egg shells to hatch them and prevent the four stacks, which pile up from the falling monsters, from growing too tall. The player character Mario swaps the stacks around such that the falling monsters will be eliminated by coming into contact with the blocks they match.\n\nMonsters, which consist of various Mario enemies, appear at the top of the screen and fall into each the columns, turning into blocks as they land and creating stacks that incrementally grow in height. The main objective is to prevent the four stacks from growing too high by eliminating blocks from the field; a game over occurs when any of the stacks crosses the black line drawn across the top of the play field.[2]\n\nTo eliminate a block from the top of a stack, it must come in contact with a falling monster that matches it. For example, if a Goomba falls directly onto a Goomba block, both will be removed. The player controls Mario, who resides below the playing field and has the ability to swap the positions of any two adjacent stacks at a time. Thus, the player is required to switch around the stacks to ensure that the monsters fall into the correct places. Points are awarded for each set of monsters that are eliminated.[2]\n\nIn addition to the four different types of monsters, two halves of a Yoshi eggshell will also fall. The bottom eggshell half behaves like a monster: it disappears when it comes into contact with another bottom half. However, if a falling top half comes into contact with a bottom half, the two will join and hatch a Yoshi, earning the player bonus points. Furthermore, if a stack of monsters grows atop a bottom half and a top half is then added, all monsters between the halves will be encased and eliminated. Larger Yoshi characters will hatch depending on the number of monsters encased, which also increases the number of bonus points awarded.[2] If a falling top half does not have any bottom half to join to in the stack it touches, it is automatically removed and no points are awarded.\n\nThe single-player mode has two variations: A-Type and B-Type. In A-Type, the game is played indefinitely until the player receives a game over. In B-Type, the player plays a series of levels in which the player is required to completely clear the playing field of all the blocks. The initial number of blocks inside the playing field grows as the player progresses. In multiplayer mode, a second player controls Luigi. The two players play simultaneously in separate playing fields using the traditional rules. A player wins the match by clearing all the blocks in the field or when the other receives a game over; the first player to win three matches wins overall.", release_date: "12/14/1991", platform: "Nintendo Game Boy", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/38049-1.jpg"},

  {title: "Super Mario Bros. Special", description: "Super Mario Bros. Special was developed by Hudson Soft and released in 1986 for the NEC PC-88.\n\nWhile superficially very similar to the original Super Mario Bros., the game features original new levels and has a screen-by-screen scrolling mechanism. When a player reaches the end of a screen, the screen turns blank and loads the next part of the level. Jumping and dashing physics also differ from the original NES, providing a more challenging experience than Super Mario Bros. Adding difficulty is the fact that the stage time is faster than in the original NES game. Returning was Mario's Hammer from Donkey Kong, alongside a variety of past foes from earlier arcade Mario titles, and new exclusive items.\n\nDue to the PC-88 being inferior to that of the NES/Famicom, the graphics and audio differ slightly from the original game as well, although they are closely replicated. Additionally, the game does not include Luigi nor does it contain a multiplayer mode. The Sharp X1 version contains partial scrolling and slightly more colorful graphics, containing green and white colors. While the PC-88 is able to produce eight colors, the Sharp X1 uses dithering to provide additional colors into one pixel. Special only uses half of the PC-88's hardware palette, restricted to only black, red, yellow, and blue, including dithered results with those four colors. Sprites exclude the use of blue to allow transparency in the sprites.\n\nThe Warp Zones from the original were changed in such a way that Special has no true Warp Zone. In World 1-2, reaching the area over the pipe instead leads to the single bonus room that could be accessed normally in the stage, but with a pipe that still leads to the overworld, thus to the end of the level. In World 4-2, a room that more resembles a true Warp Zone can be found, however the only pipe it holds does not have any destinations defined, likely due to an oversight by the developers. The pipe can still be entered, but the player will remain stuck there indefinitely, forcing the player to be killed by the timer.", release_date: "09/12/1986", platform: "PC-88", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/31791-1.jpg"},

For this reason it is also generally considered to be a spin-off title from the main Zelda series. Stylistically similar to The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past for the SNES, BS Zelda no Densetsu: Inishie no Sekiban is also occasionally regarded as an enhanced remake of this title.

Each city spans multiple tiles so you can custom build your cities to take full advantage of the local terrain.\nACTIVE RESEARCH: Unlock boosts that speed your civilization's progress through history.

Similar units can also be combined to form powerful \"Corps\" units.\nENHANCED MULTIPLAYER: In addition to traditional multiplayer modes, cooperate and compete with your friends in a wide variety of situations all designed to be easily completed in a single session.\nA CIV FOR ALL PLAYERS: Civilization VI provides veteran players new ways to build and tune their civilization for the greatest chance of success.

  {title: "Sid Meier's Civilization III: Conquests", description: "Civilization III: Conquests is the second and final expansion for the award-winning and best-selling computer game Civilization III. It was published in 2003. This expansion added eight new civilizations to the game, and including the eight civilizations from Play the World this brings the total number of playable civilizations up to thirty-one (the maximum supported by the game). The new civilizations are the Byzantines, the Dutch, the Hittites, the Incans, the Mayans, the Portuguese and the Sumerians. In addition to these playable civilizations, graphics for the Austrians are present in the editor so one can replace an existing civilization.\n\nTwo new special traits are added in this pack: seafaring and agricultural. Many of the new civilizations take advantage of these new traits (e.g. the Sumerians are Scientific and Agricultural), and some old civilizations are changed to more appropriate ones (e.g. the English have been changed from Expansionist and Commercial to Seafaring and Commercial).\n\nNew governments have also been added to the game, Feudalism and Fascism, and new Wonders of the World such as the Statue of Zeus and the Mausoleum of Mausollos. Four new bonus resources have been included, two of which provide food bonuses to previously unprofitable terrain. Oases can now be found in deserts, tropical fruit in jungles, sugar on plains and hills, and tobacco on grasslands and hills. In addition, two new types of terrain have been added. These are marshes and volcanoes. Players cannot construct cities on marshes, and cannot improve volcanoes in any way. Like jungles and flood plains, cities that have at least 1 citizen working a marsh may succumb to disease. Volcanoes may periodically erupt, destroying all improvements and cities and killing any units in some or all adjacent squares.\n\nThe centerpiece of this expansion pack, however, was the inclusion of scenarios, intended for multiplayer gaming. Unlike the main (\"epic\") game, these scenarios took much less time to play, and focused on a specific period in history.\n\nGenerally the reception of this expansion pack was much better than that of Play the World.\n\nOne year after Conquests was launched, the latest Civilization III stand-alone version, Civilization III: Complete was also released. This version included Civilization III, Play the World and Conquests. This version also includes several patches.\n\nTwo years later, in 2005 Civilization IV was released.", release_date: "11/06/2003", platform: "PC", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/14389-1.jpg"},

When such a line is created, it disappears, and any block above the deleted line will fall. With every ten lines that are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the tetrominoes to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of tetrominoes reaches the top of the playing field and no new tetrominoes are able to enter. In certain versions, the game can also end if the player is able to get all the way to level 15.\n\nAll of the tetrominoes are capable of single and double clears.

When Tengen released its first unofficial games using its new technology, Nintendo quickly sued. This was just the beginning of the Tengen/Nintendo feud. Ignoring Nintendo's claim to the Tetris name in the US a year later, Tengen released its own version of the world's most famous puzzle game on an unlocked, unofficial cartridge. Tengen's tetris was pulled from shelves almost immediately when it was revealed that Nintendo's hold on the Tetris name stateside was legitimate. Unfortunately, almost everyone agrees that Tengen's version of the game was far superior to Nintendo's, even including a two-player mode which Nintendo's version sorely lacked.

It was released on 22 October 2001 for the PlayStation 2 console, on 20 May 2002 for Microsoft Windows, and on 31 October 2003 for the Xbox console. It is the fifth title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 1999's Grand Theft Auto 2.\n\nGrand Theft Auto III is played from a third-person perspective in an open world single-player environment, allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The game is set within the fictional city of Liberty City, which is loosely based on New York City.[b] The story features a mute, nameless protagonist, although he is later referred to as Claude in his cameo in the prequel Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.[c] Claude is a bank robber who is left for dead by his girlfriend, and quickly becomes entangled in a world of gangs, crime, and corruption.\n\nUpon its release, the game was acclaimed by many reviewers who praised its concept and gameplay, which was coupled with the use of a 3D game engine for the first time in the series. However, the game's violent and sexual content has been the source of much public concern and controversy. It became the best-selling video game of 2001, and has sold over 17 million copies as of 2011. The game is cited as a landmark in video games for its far-reaching influence within the industry. The success of Grand Theft Auto III was a significant factor in the series' subsequent popularity; as of 2008, five prequels set before the events of Grand Theft Auto III have been released, particularly Grand Theft Auto: Liberty City Stories which revisits the Liberty City setting just three years prior.\n\nIts successor, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, was released on 27 October 2002, and also received critical acclaim. In December 2011, in celebration of the game's tenth anniversary, a mobile version of Grand Theft Auto III was released for iOS and Android.

Since the runaway success of Grand Theft Auto III on PS2, the GTA games have been praised by players and vilified by politicians. All three 128-bit generation GTA games -- Grand Theft Auto III, Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas -- are included in this box set.\n\nGrand Theft Auto III casts players as a low-level thug in a grungy, New York-styled urban game world called Liberty City. Liberty City is made up of three districts, and in all, the game offers 72 different missions, many of which can be played in any order. As the player's character completes jobs available in one part of the city, other areas and assignments open up to him. Along with this purposeful design of an open-ended, non-linear storyline, many other features popular in earlier versions of the game return in this release as well, including a diverse variety of deadly weapons, busy streets full of self-involved pedestrians, and eight different radio station soundtracks to listen to while inside the vehicles.\n\nGrand Theft Auto: Vice City offers the same open-ended style of play as its violent, \"M\"-rated predecessor, but in an area twice as large as Liberty City, and with a completely different theme. Seemingly inspired by television's stylish crime drama, Miami Vice, Vice City takes place in the 1980s. Criminals wear pastel-colored suits, bikini-clad women relax on sandy beaches, and palm tree-lined streets are bustling with showy sports cars and zippy motorcycles.\n\nLike its immediate predecessor, San Andreas strives to provide a wide, deep foundation for its free-form criminal gameplay by setting the story in a slightly exaggerated representation of a familiar (if not glorified) American subculture. As Vice City seemed inspired by Miami Vice, and the pastel-decked, \"me generation\" ideals of the early '80s, San Andreas is set in a time and place suggested by films like Boyz N the Hood, Menace II Society, or Colors. Players take the role of Carl \"C.J.\" Johnson, who thought he had escaped the gangland lifestyle by moving away from his Los Santos home. When his mother is murdered, he returns to the neighborhood of his childhood, only to become embroiled with threats and danger from all sides.\n\nEditor's Note: The version of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas included in this compilation has been rated \"M\" by the ESRB, and contains no working remnants of the controversial \"Hot Coffee\" sequence found in the title's original release.", release_date: "12/11/2006", platform: "Sony Playstation 2", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/12909-1.jpg"},

  {title: "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion - Game of the Year Edition", description: "The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks and the Take-Two Interactive subsidiary, 2K Games. It is the fourth installment in The Elder Scrolls action fantasy video game series, following The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and preceding The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Oblivion was first released in March 2006 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. A mobile phone version of the game was released in May 2006, and a PlayStation 3 version was shipped in March 2007. After a number of smaller content releases, a major expansion pack, Shivering Isles, was distributed. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition (a package including both Shivering Isles and the official expansion pack Knights of the Nine) was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. A fifth-anniversary edition was shipped in 2011.\n\nOblivion '​s main story revolves around the player character's efforts to thwart a fanatical cult known as the \"Mythic Dawn\" that plans to open the gates to a realm called \"Oblivion\". The game continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of certain abilities. Seven skills are selected early in the game as major skills, with the remainder termed minor. Developers opted for tighter pacing in gameplay and greater plot focus than in past titles.\n\nDevelopment for Oblivion began in 2002, directly after the release of Morrowind. To design the graphics, Bethesda used an improved Havok physics engine, high dynamic range lighting, procedural content generation tools that allowed developers to quickly create detailed terrains, and the Radiant A.I. system, which enabled non-player characters (NPCs) to make choices and engage in behaviors more complex than in past titles. The game features fully voiced NPCs—a first for the series—and the music of award-winning composer Jeremy Soule. Overall, Oblivion was well received by critics, and has won a number of industry and publication awards. It was praised for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Within a month, the game had shipped over 1.7 million copies, and by November 2011, sold over 3.5 million. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide.", release_date: "10/16/2007", platform: "Sony Playstation 3", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/12319-1.jpg"},

It was released in North America in 2002 for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox. Well-received publicly and critically, with over four million sales[3] and more than 60 awards (including Game of the Year),[4] the game spawned two expansion packs for the PC: Tribunal and Bloodmoon. Both were eventually repackaged into a full set containing all three, Morrowind: Game of the Year Edition, which shipped on October 30, 2003, for both PC and Xbox.[5]\n\nThe main story takes place on Vvardenfell, an island in the Dunmer province of Morrowind, which lies in the empire of Tamriel and is far from the more civilized lands to the west and south that typified Daggerfall and Arena. The central quests concern the deity Dagoth Ur, housed within the volcanic Red Mountain, who seeks to gain power and break Morrowind free from Imperial reign.[6][7][8] Morrowind was designed with an open-ended free-form style of gameplay in mind, with less of an emphasis on the game's main plot than its predecessors.

  {title: "Battlefield Hardline", description: "Battlefield Hardline features new variety of gameplay that breaks away from the traditional Battlefield game modes. The focus of the game has been shifted to police and the \"war on crime\", breaking away from the military setting that has hitherto characterized the series. As such, the main factions in Hardline are the police Special Response Units and criminals. Players will have access to various military-grade weapons and vehicles, such as the Lenco BearCat, as well as having police equipment such as tasers and handcuffs.\n\nHardline also uses the Levolution mechanic from Battlefield 4. For example, in the map \"Downtown\" players can send a construction crane crashing into the building, ripping down debris from the central buildings in downtown, which falls down on the streets of Los Angeles. But, this time, every map features multiple levolutionary events, both small and gigantic.\n\nMany new game modes are featured in Hardline, for instance: Heist, Rescue, Hotwire Mode, Blood Money and Crosshair Mode.\n\nHeist: The criminals must break into a cash filled vault (or as featured in some maps, blow open the doors of an armoured truck) then move the cash filled packages to an extraction point; the police must stop them. If the Criminals manage to escape by bringing all the money to the extraction point they win.\n\nBlood Money: Both factions must retrieve money from an open crate in the center of the map, then move it back to their respective side's armored truck. Players can also steal money from the opposing team's truck. The team that first deposits $5 million worth of money into their truck or the team with the most money under a time limit wins.\n\nHotwire Mode: Drivable cars take the role of traditional Conquest \"flags.\" Like Conquest, capturing cars (done by driving above a certain \"cruising\" speed) will bleed the enemy team's reinforcement tickets. The team who reduces the other's to zero or who has the most tickets remaining after the time limit wins.\n\nRescue: In a 3 minute long 5 vs 5 competitive mode, S.W.A.T officers must try to rescue hostages held by criminal forces. The cops win by either rescuing the hostage(s) or by killing all the criminals. Criminals win by killing all the cops. Each player has only one life in this mode, that means no respawns.\n\nCrosshair: The second competitive game mode in Battlefield Hardline. Crosshair is also 3 minutes long, 5 vs 5 with only one life. In Crosshair the criminals are trying to kill a player controlled VIP on the cops side who is a former gang member turned states witness. The criminals win by killing the VIP and the cops win by getting the VIP to the extraction point.\n\nVisceral Games ratified that the single-player campaign will not be linear and promised to deliver a better one than the predecessors. The campaign will feature episodic crime dramas where choices will heavily change situational outcomes and gameplay experiences. As a cop, players can use multiple police gadgets and personal equipments. The police badge can be used to strike fear into criminals' hearts and order them to lay down their weapons, the scanner is used to stake out a situation, identify high value-targets, log evidences, tag alarms, and mark other threats. To slip past unnoticed, players can use bullet cases to distract enemies.", release_date: "03/17/2015", platform: "Microsoft Xbox One", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/26195-1.jpg"},

  {title: "The Sims 2", description: "The Sims 2 is a 2004 strategic life simulation video game developed by Maxis and published by Electronic Arts. It is the sequel to the best-selling computer game The Sims.[1]\n\nThe game has the same concept as its predecessor: players control their Sims in various activities and form relationships in a manner similar to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's pre-built neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on Shakespearean characters.\n\nThe Sims 2 was first released on September 14, 2004 for Microsoft Windows. A port to Apple Mac OS X was released on June 17, 2005. Eight expansion packs and nine stuff packs were subsequently released. In addition several console versions have been released. The Sims 2 is offered on mobile platforms, with manufacturers such as Nokia offering The Sims 2 from the Ovi Store. A sequel, The Sims 3, was released in June 2009.[2][3]\n\nThe Sims 2 was a commercial success, selling one million copies in its first ten days, a record at the time.[4] During April 2008, The Sims 2 website announced that 100 million copies of The Sims series had been sold.[5] The Sims 2 was well received by critics, gaining a 90% score from aggregators Metacritic and GameRankings.[6][7] As of March 2012, The Sims 2 has sold at least six million PC copies and 13 million over all platforms, making it one of the best-selling PC games of all-time.[8]", release_date: "10/24/2005", platform: "Nintendo GameCube", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/30911-1.jpg"},

A magnificent land; one that is not bound by restrictions such as time.\n\n15 years have passed since Sonic the Hedgehog's first plight against the nefarious Dr. Eggman (originally known as Dr. Ivo Robotnik in English localisations). Ever since, the two sides have clashed nonstop in a variety of settings, with the eventual outcome always being Sonic's victory. Both sides have gained both new allies and new enemies; some helpful, others... not so much. Naturally, throughout this time, Sonic has learned a few new techniques, which he uses to further stifle Eggman's plans of world domination. And so, the world is safe - but always just out of Eggman's grasp.\n\nSome say history repeats itself. In this case, the statement is proven true, as Eggman returns to South Island, in hopes that he can obtain the land's powerful Chaos Emeralds, and finally put forth a solid step in conquering the planet. As he arrives on the island, he brings with him a single Chaos Emerald - one that had been missing, and had upset the natural balance of the island for decades beforehand. The others were trapped in an alternate dimension; one which only very few could enter, and from which even fewer returned.\n\nOf course, Eggman isn't very good at keeping his plans secret (a big reason why they're foiled so easily). As a result, Sonic hears of this, and readies his travel back to South Island. With him, he brings two allies: one being Mighty the Armadillo, a longtime friend of his (though they had not spoken in quite some time); and the other being Shadow the Hedgehog who, after finally getting over his angst (at least for the moment), felt like teaching Eggman a thing or two about trying the same thing twice. And besides that, he had never seen South Island before; he had heard things about it, certainly, but never saw it for himself. So, he figured, why not?\n\nAnd so, the three begin their trek of South Island, each taking their own unique abilities with them, and going their separate ways, each in search of the remaining Chaos Emeralds, and of Eggman, in hopes that once he is defeated, he will finally abandon his plans of world domination. But, then again, that's not very likely to happen.\n\nWe can all dream, I suppose.", release_date: "08/13/2008", platform: "Sega Genesis", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/26691-1.jpg"},

He and protagonist Sonic the Hedgehog must stop the series antagonist Dr. Ivo Robotnik from stealing the Chaos Emeralds in order to power his space station, called the Death Egg.\n\nDevelopment of the game began in November 1991, two months later than originally intended, because Sega of America felt that it was too soon for a sequel. Both American and Japanese Sonic Team staff contributed to development; art director Tim Skelly designed the appearance of the game's new 3D special stages, based on an earlier tech demo created by Yuji Naka. The staff increased the speed of Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in comparison to its predecessor.

Also included is a second DVD that explores the making of Gears of War with lead designer Cliff Bleszinski and his development team.\n\nAnointed by the games media as Microsoft's first \"killer app\" for its Xbox 360, Epic Games' Gears of War is a futuristic third-person shooter emphasizing tactical action over run-and-gun battles. Players are thrust in a climactic clash between what's left of humankind and a swarming underground race called the Locust Horde. The main protagonist is Marcus Fenix, a once disgraced soldier looking to redeem himself by leading a ragtag squad against the monstrous threat.\n\nSince the alien army vastly outnumbers the team, players must use the post-apocalyptic world to their advantage, such as seeking cover behind dumpsters, pillars, cars, rubble, and other objects. The developer has adapted its award-winning Unreal technology to create interactive environments with a physics-based damage system. Players, for instance, can shoot down structures to forge new routes or opportunities to trap the enemy. Up to three squad mates will accompany Fenix in each mission, with basic commands such as \"advance,\" \"hold,\" or \"freelance\" available to guide them.\n\nA behind-the-shoulder view similar to the one employed in Capcom's Resident Evil 4 is the default perspective in Gears of War. Weapons include an assortment of grenades, pistols, assault rifles, and other long-range blasters, many of which offer a means to engage enemies in melee combat. The Locust Horde is not averse to lunging, rushing, or gnawing at soldiers, so players have the opportunity to perform grisly finishing moves by quickly tapping specific button sequences during close encounters. Cooperative support for two players is offered throughout the campaign, and up to eight can battle each other in team-oriented modes via Xbox Live.", release_date: "11/21/2006", platform: "Microsoft Xbox 360", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/16163-1.jpg"},

In the game, players control an unnamed protagonist who must venture through a series of dungeons to defeat the Grand Vizier Jaffar and save an imprisoned princess.\n\nMuch like Karateka, Mechner's first game, Prince of Persia used rotoscoping for its fluid and realistic animation. For this process, Mechner used as reference for the characters' movements videos of his brother doing acrobatic stunts in white clothes and swashbuckler films such as The Adventures of Robin Hood.\n\nThe game was critically acclaimed and, while not an immediate commercial success, sold many copies as it was ported to a wide range of platforms after the original Apple II release. It is believed to have been the first cinematic platformer and inspired many following games in this subgenre, such as Another World.[4] Its success led to the release of two sequels, The Shadow and the Flame and Prince of Persia 3D, and a reboot of the series starting in 2003 with The Sands of Time.", release_date: "01/01/1990", platform: "Amstrad CPC", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/28269-1.jpg"},

She unwittingly unleashes him and finds herself in a deadly race against time to restore the god to his resting place before an apocalypse befalls Earth.\n \nUnfortunately, Von Croy becomes Lara's new rival as he is possessed by Set himself and he makes things considerably more difficult. Lara travels across Egypt to collect the pieces of Horus' armour in order to defeat Set. They are found in Pharos, Temple of Isis, Temple of Poseidon and Cleopatra's Palaces. She combines them (with the Amulet of Horus) in the Temple of Horus to finally defeat her enemy. However before Horus can be summoned, Set arrives and destroys the armour, knocking the amulet into the water. Lara quickly recovers it and exits the Temple sealing the entrance shut with the amulet. She must leave it in place to keep Set imprisoned for eternity. As she reaches the exit of the temple, injured and exhausted, she is confronted by Von Croy. Fearful that he may still be possessed she is reluctant to hold onto his outstretched hands and so she falls into the darkness beneath the collapsing temple.", release_date: "11/22/1999", platform: "PC", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/2566-1.jpg"},

  {title: "Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands", description: "The Prince is riding through a desert on his horse, on a quest to see his brother, Malik, and learn about leadership from him. When the Prince arrives at Malik's kingdom, he finds it under attack by an army which is attempting to breach the treasure vaults for a great power known as \"Solomon's Army\". The Prince charges in to the city, and tracks Malik to the treasure vaults. Here, Malik says that he is fighting a losing battle and proposes to rely on a last resort or be forced to retreat. The Prince strongly objects, but Malik releases Solomon's Army using a magical seal. Solomon's Army is an assortment of different creatures, all made of sand. The Prince and Malik both manage to obtain halves of the seal used to keep the army contained, protecting them from being turned into sand statues, which is the fate of the rest of the kingdom.\n\nMalik is separated from the Prince, who finds a portal to the domain of Razia, a Djinn of the Marid race. Razia tells the Prince that the only way to re-imprison Solomon's Army is to reunite both halves of the seal. Razia gives the Prince special powers and sends him to find Malik, and the other half of the seal. When the Prince finds Malik, he is not interested in stopping Solomon's Army, but instead wants to destroy it and use its power to become a more powerful leader. This is explained by Razia: whereas the Prince is using the power gifted to him by Razia, Malik is using power taken directly from those he defeats. The Army's sand is gradually affecting his mind, making him susceptible to Ratash's influence. The Prince again sets out to find Malik, but this time to forcibly take his half of the seal. When he finds him, Malik is stronger and manages to escape. Pursuing Malik again, the Prince finds Ratash, Ifrit leader of the Army, searching for the seal. After the Prince outruns him, he concludes Ratash must now be chasing Malik, and so sets out to aid him. The Prince arrives in the throne room to find Malik and Ratash fighting, and he aids Malik. The Prince and Malik seem to kill Ratash, and Malik absorbs his power, shattering his half of the seal. Malik then runs off, seemingly in a hysterical fit, using some of Ratash's powers to escape.\n\nThe Prince pursues him, and again finds Razia. Razia explains that Ratash cannot be killed by any ordinary sword, and that what actually happened was quite different from what the Prince saw: Ratash has actually killed Malik, and possessed his body. The Prince doesn't believe this, and sets out to find the Djinn Sword, hidden in the ancient city of Rekem, which Razia says can kill Ratash. Along the way, the Prince chases Malik, now being used by Ratash to retake the Ifrit's original form. The Prince loses a battle to Ratash and, convinced his brother is truly dead, finds the Djinn Sword. Razia soon bonds with the sword, giving it the power needed to destroy Ratash. The Prince again searches for Ratash. When he finds him, Ratash is now gigantic, literally fed by the sandstorm which has come over the palace. The Prince uses the sword to kill Ratash, and, when the sandstorm subsides, he finds Malik dying. Malik says to tell their father that Prince will be as mighty a leader as Solomon, then dies. In an epilogue, the Prince tells of how he took the sword back to Rekem, where he thought Razia would want to rest, and how he must now set out to inform his father of Malik's death.", release_date: "05/18/2010", platform: "Nintendo DS", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/38947-1.jpg"},

The six were intended to cause the large, inhabited floating sphere named Cocoon to fall into the world below, named Gran Pulse, killing all of the humans of Cocoon. At the finale of the game, two of the l'Cie transformed into a crystal pillar to support Cocoon, preventing the catastrophe.\n\nXIII-2 begins three years after the end of XIII. Owing to the fall of Cocoon at the end of XIII and the collapse of its government (the Sanctum), at the start of XIII-2, most of Cocoon's inhabitants have moved down onto Gran Pulse, and some have learned magical abilities. Over the course of the game, a scientific body called the Academy becomes a new technocratic government. While the game starts off in the year 3 AF ('AF' being a new timescale set up after the fall of Cocoon), the story of XIII-2 jumps around several different time periods, and even parallel versions of different places, accessed via the Historia Crux. While most of the game takes place on Gran Pulse and inside Cocoon, there are two other major locations. One is the Void Beyond, a limbo between time periods. The other location is Valhalla, the capital of the goddess Etro.

  {title: "Donkey Kong", description: "Donkey Kong is an arcade game released by Nintendo in 1981. It is an early example of the platform game genre, as the gameplay focuses on maneuvering the main character across a series of platforms while dodging and jumping over obstacles. In the game, Jumpman (since renamed Mario) must rescue a damsel in distress, Lady (now named Pauline) from a giant ape named Donkey Kong. The hero and ape later became two of Nintendo's most popular characters.\nThe game was the latest in a series of efforts by Nintendo to break into the North American market. Hiroshi Yamauchi, Nintendo's president at the time, assigned the project to a first-time game designer named Shigeru Miyamoto. Drawing from a wide range of inspirations, including Popeye, Beauty and the Beast and King Kong, Miyamoto developed the scenario and designed the game alongside Nintendo's chief engineer, Gunpei Yokoi. The two men broke new ground by using graphics as a means of characterization, including cut scenes to advance the game's plot, and integrating multiple stages into the gameplay.\nDespite initial misgivings on the part of Nintendo's American staff, Donkey Kong proved a success in North America and Japan. Nintendo licensed the game to Coleco, who developed home console versions for numerous platforms. Other companies cloned Nintendo's hit and avoided royalties altogether. Miyamoto's characters appeared on cereal boxes, television cartoons, and dozens of other places. A lawsuit brought on by Universal City Studios, alleging Donkey Kong violated their trademark of King Kong, ultimately failed. The success of Donkey Kong and Nintendo's win in the courtroom helped position the company to dominate the video game market from its release in 1981, until the mid 1990s.", release_date: "07/09/1981", platform: "Arcade", cover: "http://thegamesdb.net/banners/boxart/thumb/original/front/7862-1.jpg"},

Check out the following different characters of the game play of Modern Warfare2:\n\nSergeant Gary Sanderson (Roach) - He is a member of a multinational and elite commando unit called Task Force 141.\n\nPrivate First Class Josepha Allen (Ranger) - This is the character that is staged in Afghanistan but who works undercover for the CIA in Russia under the name of Alexei Borodini.\n\nPrivate James Ramirez (Officer of the Ranger Regiment) - He is the first battalion's 75th Ranger Regiment in United States and is an important character that serves in defending the eastern coast of United States from Russian invasion.\n\nJohn Mac Travis (Soap) - He is an important character in the final three missions of the game play. He also assumes the role of the International Space Station Astronaut.\n\nThe Plot of the Game:\n\nThis game starts of in Afghanistan where First class Joseph Allen assists in taking the city from the insurgents. General Shepherd is impressed by Allen's combat abilities and recruits him in the task force 141 which is a multi National Counter Terrorists unit which runs under Shepherds commands. In the meantime, Roach and Soap who are both dominant characters according to the games scale, are taken to a mountain of the Tian Shan to infiltrate an airbase in Kazakhstan.\n\nAllen is then sent off on an under cover mission to Russia and he works under the CIA and goes under the name of Alexei Borodin. At the Zakhaev international Airport in Moscow, Allen joins Makarov in a massacre of civilians and as the story unfolds it reveals that Marakov was aware of the true identity of Allen and wanted to expose him so that the Russian police would believe that America was responsible for all the killing and the terrorist attacks. As the Russians are to believe the Americans are responsible for the massacre killing, they are angered and ready to retaliate with a massive surprise attack on America.\n\nIn this sequel of the Call of Duty game play, the non-playable characters play a dominate role. Soap returns as an NPC and serves as the superior officer and mentor to Roach. The other important character is the mysterious Simon Ghost Riley who wears a mask to conceal his face which is actually a skull print Balaclava.", release_date: "11/10/2009", platform: "PC", cover: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/db/Modern_Warfare_2_cover.PNG"},
  {title: "Super Mario Brothers 2", description: "Originally released in Japan as Super Mario Bros.® 2, this game has previously made only brief cameo appearances in the Western hemisphere. Mario fans will appreciate the familiar look and feel of the game, while finding that its updated game play creates an entirely new challenge. No longer content just to wear different-colored overalls, Mario and Luigi also possess different skill sets (Mario can stop quicker, while Luigi can jump higher). In addition to the classic enemies already known to fans worldwide, there are also Poison Mushrooms, backward Warp Zones, and the occasional wind gust (which can help or hinder your progress) to take into account. And if that’s somehow not enough, expert players can go looking for the game’s secret worlds. So get ready to put your Mario skills to the ultimate test, and save the Princess again.

  {title: "Sid Meier's Civilization II", description: "Starting out with just a single unit and knowledge of a small local area, your challenge is to guide your civilization into becoming the dominant force, either by conquering every other civilization or by sending a spaceship to Alpha Centauri.\n\nAs you'd imagine, a lot of challenges come into such a task. You must locate cities so as to make use of food, construction and trade resources, which can be later improved by constructing irrigation, roads, mines, railroads, and farmland. Each city can construct one item at a time - civilian and military units, buildings or Wonders of the World (there are 28 of these across the different eras of the game, and each can be possessed by only one city). The buildings and wonders have different effects - most buildings and some wonders improve defenses, scientific research, trade or food output, but most wonders offer unique advantages that can be used to great strategic effect.\n\nThere are over 100 scientific advancements in the game, and most require prerequisites before they can be researched. How quickly this happens depends on your scientific output, which must be traded off against financial and military concerns.\n\nCombat can occur in cities or in the open terrain - things like forests and mountains give the defense an advantage. Unlike in the original Civilization, fights aren't always won outright - most times the winning unit will be damaged, reducing its movement speed and attacking prowess until it's repaired, but the losing unit always disappears from game. If multiple units are in a square that come sunder attack, the strongest unit fights - unless it is a city or Fortress, all units will be lost if the fight is lost. Once a city has no defensive units left, it can be captured. Certain units have the ability to cover all squares as fast as if they were roads, only a few can see submarines, and air units require re-fueling in a friendly city.\n\nThere are up to 6 other Civilizations in the game, and keeping good diplomatic relations with these is crucial. At times you may want to trade knowledge or pool military resources with a neighbor - at others they may want to destroy you. If you make deals and go back on them your reputation is affected.", release_date: "02/29/1996", platform: "PC", cover: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/7/73/Civ2boxart.jpg"},

In both, the player has to capture outposts, and when enough have been captured, the other team's tickets, which are essentially lives, start to fall down slowly. The more people of a team are taking an outpost at the same time, the more quickly this team will capture the outpost. There is no plot at all except that the player is a United States or Vietcong soldier in the Vietnam war.", release_date: "03/15/2004", platform: "PC", cover: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/29/Battlefield_Vietnam_Coverart.png"},
  {title: "Fable", description: "Fable is an action role-playing open world video game in the Fable series. It was developed for Xbox, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows platforms, by Big Blue Box, a satellite developer of Lionhead Studios, and was published by Microsoft. The game shipped for Xbox on 14 September 2004. An extended version of the game, Fable: The Lost Chapters, was released for Xbox and Microsoft Windows in September 2005; Feral Interactive ported the game to the Mac platform on 31 March 2008 and Robosoft Technologies created the platform after a delay of more than two years due to licensing issues.\n\nOriginally developed under the name Project Ego, Fable‍ '​s development involved more than 150 people. The game's music was composed by Russell Shaw, with the opening title theme written by Oscar-nominated composer Danny Elfman. The game's release was widely anticipated, due in part to Lionhead creator Peter Molyneux's enthusiastic hype of the game.\n\nFable was well received by critics for the quality of its gameplay and execution, though the failure to include many promised features was noted. Fable was the top-selling game of September 2004 and sold more than two million units by 2007. The game was followed by two sequels, Fable II in 2008, and Fable III in 2010. A high-definition remake of the game, entitled Fable Anniversary, which includes The Lost Chapters was released in February 2014 for the Xbox 360.[2]", release_date: "09/14/2004", platform: "PC", cover: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/5/5b/Fablebox.jpg"},

All seems well in the world, until the wind suddenly stops, the sea begin to grow stagnant, the heat of fire becomes scarce, and the earth begins to wither. King Tycoon, sensing a premonition of evil, hurries off to check on the Wind Crystal, only to witness it destroy itself.\n\nMeanwhile, a young traveler named Butz is camping in a field when a giant meteor strikes the planet. When he heads out to examine the meteor, he is shocked to find a young girl named Lenna, who is the princess of Tycoon, and a old man named Galuf, who is on a critical mission. Later, joined by Faris, a pirate captain, the foursome must travel the land in search of the destructor of the Crystals, and save the planet at any cost!\n\nFinal Fantasy V featured many new gameplay options and tactics, including an improved Job/Ability system (like in Final Fantasy Tactics), the return of the ATB (Active Time Battle) turn system, and all of the classic FF gameplay you've come to know and love!\n\nFinal Fantasy V was released as a stand-alone game in Japan, and again in Final Fantasy Collection. Its U.S. debut was as part of Final Fantasy Anthology. It was also later ported to the Gameboy Advance, adding 4 new Jobs, a new 30-floor dungeon, a bestiary, a music player, the ability to quick save anywhere, a few extra pieces of equipment, and a newly update translation.", release_date: "12/06/1992", platform: "Super Nintendo (SNES)", cover: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b3/Final_Fantasy_V_-_Original_Sound_Version_(reprint)'s_front_cover.jpg"},
  {title: "Super Metroid", description: "Super Metroid (スーパーメトロイド Sūpā Metoroido?)[a] is an action-adventure video game published by Nintendo, developed by its Research & Development 1 (R&D1) division, and programmed by Intelligent Systems for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The third game in the Metroid series, it was released in Japan on March 19, 1994, in North America on April 18, and in Europe and Australia on July 28.\n\nSuper Metroid was directed and written by Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Makoto Kano with Gunpei Yokoi serving as general manager. Super Metroid is a direct sequel to the 1991 game Metroid II: Return of Samus. In the game's story, bounty hunter Samus Aran brought a Metroid larva from the planet SR388 to the Ceres space colony, where scientists believed that they could harness its power. After leaving the colony, Samus received a distress call and returned to find that the Metroid larva was stolen by the Space Pirate leader, Ridley. Samus follows him to the planet Zebes in attempts to retrieve a stolen larva. Super Metroid '​s gameplay focuses on exploration, and its progression revolves around the search for power-ups that are used to reach previously inaccessible areas. The game introduces new concepts to the series, such as the inventory screen, an automapping facility, and the ability to fire in all directions.\n\nSuper Metroid received critical acclaim, and is considered by critics to be one of the greatest video games of all time, owing to its great use of atmosphere, gameplay, audio, cinematic elements and graphics. Despite this, the game sold poorly in Japan, but fared better in North America and Europe. Super Metroid became popular among players for speedrunning, and its gameplay and design influenced other games, such as Shadow Complex and Axiom Verge. The close releases and similar gameplay concepts of Super Metroid and Konami's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night resulted in the foundations of the \"Metroidvania\" genre. The game was followed by the 2002 release of Metroid Fusion and Metroid Prime, ending the series' eight-year hiatus. Super Metroid became available as a Virtual Console title for the Wii console in 2007, and for the Wii U in 2013.", release_date: "08/20/2007", platform: "Nintendo Wii", cover: "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e4/Smetroidbox.jpg/250px-Smetroidbox.jpg"}
